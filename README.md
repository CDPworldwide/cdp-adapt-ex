# CDP Adaptation & Action Explorer

A unified platform to synthesize fragmented environmental hazard data and siloed resilience best practices, helping cities, states, regions, and their partners drive Earth-positive action.

Deployment URLs are managed in Google Cloud Run. The VitePress docs are served from [https://cdp-action-explorer.net/docs/](https://cdp-action-explorer.net/docs/). See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the current deployment topology.

The Cities, States and Regions 2025 data pipeline (notebook -> BQ -> Cloud SQL) is documented in [`docs/data_pipeline.md`](docs/data_pipeline.md), which covers the four pipeline stages and the CloudSQL migration.

### Infrastructure & Cloud Architecture

The platform is built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

- **Compute (Cloud Run)**: The Angular frontend, FastAPI backend, and standalone AI server are containerized and hosted on Cloud Run.
- **Database (Cloud SQL)**: PostgreSQL stores Cities, States and Regions analytical tables plus app-owned onboarding telemetry.
- **AI & LLM**: Ask the AI Explorer is served by the standalone `ai-server`, which exposes OpenAI-compatible chat and follow-up endpoints backed by Gemini.
- **Geospatial**: Google Maps powers the UI map, while Google Earth Engine provides hazard layer tiles through the backend.
