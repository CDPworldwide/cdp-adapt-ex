# CDP Adaptation & Action Explorer

A unified platform to synthesize fragmented environmental hazard data and siloed resilience best practices, empowering subnational governments to drive Earth-positive action.

Deployment URLs are managed in Google Cloud Run. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the current deployment topology.

### Infrastructure & Cloud Architecture

The platform is built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

- **Compute (Cloud Run)**: The Angular frontend, FastAPI backend, and standalone AI server are containerized and hosted on Cloud Run.
- **Database (Cloud SQL)**: PostgreSQL stores CSTAR analytical tables plus app-owned onboarding telemetry.
- **AI & LLM**: Ask CDP AI is served by the standalone `ai-server`, which exposes OpenAI-compatible chat and follow-up endpoints backed by Gemini.
- **Geospatial**: Google Maps powers the UI map, while Google Earth Engine provides hazard layer tiles through the backend.
